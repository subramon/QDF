Test compression
Test incremental and solidify with a lightR_merge incr 
Test model scoring
HTTP interface for model scoring 
  input is data, output is scoring, model assumed to exist
  input is data and model, output is scoring

Need to clean up UI with Utpal.

Get access to test data for all components from Mahdi 
Get access to Hive and scp the data

Do real run of mode 2
Drop PLP from checker

Correctness!!!
Finish rclient compressed data frame and share with Simon

Mahdi feedback on decision tree paper


Make sure that all ut* are represented in run_all.sh

Test return of table of formulas for DFE

Test length and width in lRBC

Need to handle fact that I need a comma at the end of the header line
to count the number of columns

In read_csv, handle strptime case as below
    /* In case the whole  input string  is consumed, the return value 
       points to the null byte at the end of the string. */
    // TODO: P3 This seg faults if ( *rslt == '\0' ) { go_BYE(-1); }
  }

Need to escape strings (see cmem.str_val)
==========================================================
Q: Are we using SIMDJSON?
A: Yes, but lRBC.lua does not care about it. It accepts a table. It is 
the responsibility of the caller to convert JSON to table using simdjson 
and then passing the table to lRBC.lua
